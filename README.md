# kiseki-books

reader for books found in the kiseki/trails game series. 

notes: 
* raw book text (html) scrapped from the Fandom wiki via Python script, not available in repo ( because bloat)
* some texts not available in EN and/or JA randomly since the Fandom wiki is horribly kept

to-do:

* [ ] change from SPA to file-based routing (i should have done this from the start)
* [ ] clean up and refactor code because it is mostly disgusting
