</p><p>All Sai had wanted was to see Martha again—to make toys for his old friend and see her smile again. How had such a simple desire led him to commit this atrocity against the lows of nature? The device felt heavy in his hands, but he kept hold of it all the same.
</p><p>‘Where did I go wrong? How can I possibly make up for this? Somebody… Please, somebody, tell me what to do...’
</p><p>For a moment, it felt like something had brushed Sai’s shoulder. It was probably just his imagination—he was so desperate for human contact his mind was playing tricks on him. But he couldn’t help looking all the same.
</p><p>‘Nobody there… Haha, of course not. I’m all alone.’
</p><p>The street was deathly silent, without so much as a breeze to disturb the fallen leaves on the ground. Sai smirked, ashamed of his own foolishness.
</p><p>How could he have let himself get his hopes up like that?
</p><p>‘Aww, I finally got to see you smile again, but you don’t look happy at all.’
</p><p>Sai knew that voice. He’d know it anywhere. He’d spent most of his life wishing he could hear it again.
</p><p>‘Martha…? I-Is that you? Please, if you’re here, show yourself! Talk to me, Martha!’
</p><p>He didn’t care if it was real or a hallucination anymore. If Martha was here, there was hope. Sai broke into a run, scrambling through the streets, but there was no sign of Martha. Only her voice remained.
</p><p>‘You’ve been crying for such a long time, Sai. I thought you’d have found to something to smile about by now.’
</p><p>‘I-I’m not crying. Why would I be sad? It’s not like you’re gone. We’ll see each other again someday, so...’
</p><p>Even as he spoke, Sai realized he was wrong—his cheeks were wet with tears. How long had he been crying?
</p><p>‘No… Deep down, I always knew that you were gone. That you weren’t coming back.’
</p><p>He’d tried to deny this—buried himself in his work to avoid thinking about it-- but there was no more hiding from the truth.
</p><p>‘I used to love making toys, I loved seeing the kids in the park play with them. But it was having my best friend alongside me that made it all worthwhile. I couldn’t accept that you were really gone, Martha. That you were really...dead.’
</p><p>The words came spilling out, and Sai became aware of a bright light that hadn’t been there before. It was so dazzling he had to shield his eyes against it. All the long hours in his workshop over the last thirty years had made him indifferent to things like weather and natural light. Now, a long-forgotten sensation was beginning to stir in his mind. He remembered what it was like to walk with warm sunshine kissing his skin.
</p><p>Sai fell to his knees. When he opened his eyes, he found himself face-to-face with his old friend.
</p><p>‘I’m sad we won’t get to play together anymore, too. But so long as you can move on and keep living your life, I’ll be right there with you.’
</p><p>A smile finally broke through Sai’s tears—a genuine one this time, one that made him look much more like his old self again.
</p><p>‘I have to move on, don’t I? Oh, Martha… I must have made you so sad all this time.’
</p><p>‘Right, that machine you made is cool and all, but it’s just not you. You always seemed happier when you were making toys.’
</p><p>‘I guess you’re right. When I try to make anything else, it always goes wrong.’
</p><p>They stayed like that for some time, chatting and catching up as if nothing had changed. In the midsts of that cold, empty world, there were still two souls with warmth in their hearts. It was like a dream come true. But during a break in their conversation, Sai realized how quiet the rest of the town was.
</p><p>It was time for the dream to end.
</p><p>‘I have to go, before everyone comes back. I told Aidios that you’re not a bad person, and you didn’t mean to do this. She said She’d forgive you if you can let me go.’
</p><p>Martha took a step backwards.
</p><p>‘Goodbye, Sai. I’m really happy I got to be friends with. And… I like you better when you smile.’
</p><p>Sai took a deep breath and rose to his feet. He had to do this right. Tears were steaming down his face, but he kept his voice steady.
</p><p>‘Thank you, Martha. I’m so glad I got to see you again. And don’t worry—I won’t let you down. I’ll live a good life. I’ll make you proud.’
</p><p>Two words from him, and the miracle that he’d worked so hard to achieve would be over. Part of him wanted to keep hiding from the truth, to make this moment last forever. But that temptation soon passed. He knew what he had to do, and he’d see off his old friend with the brightest smile he could muster. He wanted Martha to remember him like this.
</p><p>‘...Goodbye, Martha.’
</p><p>The girl was already starting to fade from view, as if melting into the sunlight. She kept waving the whole time, until finally, she was gone. Sai became dimly aware of a strange sound—a low-pitched drone that was gradually getting higher and higher.
</p><p>The world seemed to change in the blink of an eye. The town was once more teeming with life, the people on their feet again and going about their business like nothing had happened.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Sai walked through the streets in a daze. Perhaps it was instinct, or nostalgia, or Aidio’s guidance that him to the park. Children gathered around him, looking at the strange machine under his arm.
</p><p>‘Hey, Mister! What’s that thing?’
</p><p>‘What’s it for?’
</p><p>‘How does it work?’
</p><p>Sai smiled. He knelt down and started tearing apart his invention, rearranging the components into something completely different.
</p><p>‘Ta-da! It’s a butterfly. It uses orbal energy and the wind to fly.’
</p><p>‘Wow, cool!’
</p><p>‘I want one, too!’
</p><p>‘Let’s have a race and see whose can fly the farthest!’
</p><p>
Sai worked quickly, and in a few minutes, the was alive with dancing butterflies and the laughter of children.</p><p></p></blockquote><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div> </div></div> </main>
