Lesson</b>
</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud rumbling from deep within the catacombs, and an enormous dust cloud as tall as the ceiling made its way toward Coby. Instinctively, Coby covered his eyes with his free hand as the small specks of sand within the cloud pelted him.</p><p>The cloud soon vanished, and Coby lowered his hand. Though his vision was obstructed by the dust, he was able to barely make out a giant silhouette in front of him.</p><p>'It cannot be!' Shocked, the black shadow holding Coby's hand loosened its grip.</p><p>Coby didn't waste another second; he darted out from the circle the black shadows had formed around him. But a gravelly voice soon stopped him.</p><p>'Do not move, boy.'</p><p>Coby involuntarily straightened up and stopped as he had been commanded. The voice spoke once more.</p><p>'Gentle spirits, controlled by evil, I now grant you passage back to Aidios.' Then, beads of light surged toward Coby and the shadows; the latter screamed in agony as the beads of light struck them, causing them to vanish.</p><p>'Ahh!' a familiar voice screamed. Coby turned; the shadow that had gripped his hand was engulfed in the light, and the girl re-emerged as the screaming faded.</p><p>Coby and the girl stared at each other, silence falling between them. Finally, the girl spoke, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>'I'm sorry I tricked you. But I want you to know that I had fun exploring the museum with you. I was happy we were almost friends. That part was real.'</p><p>The beads of light bounced off the catacomb walls and shone on the pair, and the girl began to fade away in the light.</p><p>Coby rushed toward her and grabbed her hand. 'I believe you!' he exclaimed. 'Because of you, I was able to enjoy  the museum for the first time. I'm glad I met you! And we're already friends, right? I can't just stand here and let a friend cry!'</p><p>He kept pouring his heart out to the girl, but she continued to fade away. She initially looked surprised at his words, but soon gave him the same warm smile she'd given him when they had first met.</p><p>'Heehee... Thank you. You're right. I can't cry, now that we're finally friends.'</p><p>Coby's face fell; he could no longer feel the girl's hand in his. 'Don't worry,' the girl continued, still smiling. 'I know we'll meet again someday.'</p><p>She vanished into the light, and Coby stared at the spot where she had vanished, his vision blurred by his tears.</p><p>Eventually, the light faded away, and a familiar voice spoke, bringing Coby back to his senses.</p><p>'It appears as if you made a good friend.'</p><p>The dust cloud containing the giant silhouette cleared, and Coby could now clearly see its identity.</p><p>'A d-dragon?!' Coby said, stunned. It was indeed a magnificent dragon with brilliant wings. The dragon spoke again, its voice reverberating around the catacombs.</p><p>'You were very nearly consumed by evil spirits. Only those who do not listen to their parents will be led astray. Sound familiar, boy?'</p><p>Coby's elation at meeting a dragon subsided as a shiver ran down his spine. 'Yes,' he admitted, feeling guilty. 'Mom told me to stay close, but I didn't listen.'</p><p>The dragon stared at him with a piercing gaze. 'You do know what you did wrong, do you not, boy?'</p><p>Coby nodded silently. 'There is a rumor that exists in this museum,' the dragon continued. 'When children break their promises with their parents, they shall all be consumed by demons. You were attacked, boy, but what about your parents?'</p><p>Coby froze in horror at the dragon's words. 'NO! Not Mom and Dad, too! Please, save them!' he begged. But the dragon dropped its gaze and shook its head. 'Your parents were genuinely worried about you, the same way you worry about them now. But you brought this upon yourself, boy. Your mistakes cannot be taken back.'</p><p>Coby felt remorse for the first time in his life. He felt awful for being a nuisance to his parents and not listening to them. He fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face.</p><p>The dragon stared at the crying boy for a moment. 'However...you can shape the future with your actions. You understand what will happen if you commit the same mistakes?'</p><p>Coby wiped his face and nodded. The dragon moved closer to him; Coby could see his reflection in the dragon's piercing eyes. He suddenly felt as if he was being sucked into the dragon's eyes, and he began to lose his balance.</p><p>'Make choices your friend would be proud of,' he thought he heard the dragon say.</p><p>Coby came around and attempted to sit up, but he felt something wrapped around his legs.</p><p>'Don't move, it's too dangerous,' a worried voice said. He looked around; his mother was staring at him, while his father was carrying him. His eyes widened. 'Mom! Dad! You're okay!' Coby cried out. 'Where's the black shadow demon?!'</p><p>His mother looked puzzled. 'What do you mean? Did you have a nightmare?' she asked, concerned. Coby looked confused. 'You became tired after walking around the museum with us, so your father carried you after you fell asleep,' she explained.</p><p>Coby still looked confused, but soon felt relief wash over him, and tears began to stream down his face again. His parents looked concerned and couldn't understand why their son was upset, but they comforted him regardless.</p><p>Eventually, Coby jumped off his father's back and insisted he walk on his own.</p><p>'All right, but don't go running off, okay?' his mother said, still worried. 'You just woke up; you might trip and fall.'</p><p>Coby smiled. 'I know. But you don't need to worry about me anymore.'</p><p>Some time later, Coby visited the museum again and tried finding the door to the catacombs, but he had no such luck. He then returned to the painting of the catacombs. This time, all of the caskets were sealed, and there were now plants sprouting under a warm light.</p><p>'It looks better than before,' he said, smiling.</p><p>Coby would never forget about that particular day, and he made sure not to worry anyone ever again.</p><p>'After all,' he thought, 'I can't do anything embarrassing if I'm gonna see her again.'</p><p>Though his parents were stunned by his sudden maturity, they continued to love  him and protect him all the same. And as Coby grew up, he kept the dragon's words close to his heart, and he eventually became a respectable and mature adult in Erebonia.</p><p></p></blockquote><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div> </div></div> </main>
