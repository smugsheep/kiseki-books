<dl><dt>[Breaking Story] Coup D'etat Thwarted!</dt></dl>
<hr>
<dl><dd>◆Rescuing Her Majesty, the Queen◆</dd></dl>
<figure> <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kiseki/images/9/9a/Liberl_News_Insert_Sky_FC_916_-_Castle_Liberation.png"/> <figcaption>  <p>Liberation Group</p> </figcaption> </figure><p> Yesterday at noon, a group comprised mostly of bracers and members of the Royal Guard stormed Grancel Castle. After rescuing Her Majesty, who had been placed under house arrest by the Intelligence Division, said group suppressed the Special Operations Unit of that division, thereby liberating the royal castle. ID commanding officer, Colonel Richard, as well as other high-ranking officers involved were placed under arrest and charged with attempting to incite a coup d'etat.
</p><p>In this issue I intend to make a full account of the hidden truth behind this string of incidents.<br/>
</p>
<dl><dd>◆Message to the Readers◆</dd></dl>
<p>I am sure there are many out there who are dumbfounded by the headings printed in this issue. Up until now, this magazine has withheld publishing information concerning major events which surrounded the occupation of the royal castle, placement of Her Majesty under house arrest, and other such circumstances of pertinence in an endeavor to uncover the Intelligence Division's dark conspiracy.
</p><p>The Liberl News sincerely apologizes for the abrupt coverage, and in addition asks that the readers understand our decision in this matter.
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>- (Editor-in-Chief)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>◆Alan Richard's Plan◆</dd></dl>
<figure> <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kiseki/images/4/4c/Liberl_News_Insert_Sky_FC_907_-_Alan_Richard.png"/> <figcaption>  <p>Alan Richard</p> </figcaption> </figure><p> The young founder of the Intelligence Division -- behind his humble facade, there lurked a calculating schemer enacting a carefully-planned coup d'etat.
</p><p>Richard's plan all began through the utilization of the Intelligence Division as a personal recruitment tool to amass a group of senior military officials mired in corruption and illicit affairs. These actions allowed Richard to hold the heart of the Royal Army within the palm of his hand -- for a time, at least. General Morgan and other such incorruptible figures of importance, on the other hand, were forcibly bound, imprisoned, or otherwise restrained from interfering.<br/>
</p>
<dl><dd>◆Terrorist Incident Resolved◆</dd></dl>
<p>In sum, the soldiers in blue uniforms were the perfect imitative deception with which to frame the Royal Guards. The goal of the incident itself was to secure certain test equipment and abduct Professor Russell, the leading specialist in orbment research, but the background surrounding this event is still under investigation by the Bracer Guild.
</p>
<dl><dd>◆Royal Princess Held Hostage◆</dd></dl>
<p>After gaining control over a large majority of the army, Richard finally set his coup d'etat plan into motion. Placing Her Majesty's nephew, Duke Dunan von Auslese, on the throne in her stead, Richard assumed control over the royal family from the shadows. His plan was to press Her Majesty to abdicate the throne by taking Her Highness, Princess Klaudia, hostage, but the Royal Guard, led by 1st Lieutenant Schwarz, saw right through the machinations. A fierce battle ensued between the Special Operations Unit and the Royal Guard over Her Highness, the princess. However, being outnumbered, the Royal Guard's stand ended in defeat, and Princess Klaudia was taken captive.
</p><p>Following the incident, members of the Royal Guard were branded as terrorists, and the unit was driven underground. With nothing standing in Richard's way, the success of his coup d'etat was only a matter of time.
</p>
<dl><dd>◆Unlikely Heroes Make an Appearance◆</dd></dl>
<p>Amidst the chaos, an unheralded ray of light shone down upon the scene. A certain few individuals infiltrated the castle and slipped past the security of the Special Operations Unit. Moreover, they succeeded in meeting with Her Majesty, the Queen, who was under house arrest at the time.
</p><p>I have refrained from writing these individuals' names in deference to the Bracer Guild's request, but suffice it to say, the guild itself, which had been in the dark due to regulations sanctioned by the Intelligence Division, was for the first time able to grasp the direness of the situation, thanks to information acquired by these nameless heroes.
</p><p>After being apprised of the chain of events, the Bracer Guild would become a central force of opposition to the Intelligence Division.
</p>
<dl><dd>◆Liberation of the Queen◆</dd></dl>
<p>The Bracer Guild rendezvoused with the estranged Royal Guard and set about liberating the Erbe Royal Villa through a joint operation carried out under the veil of night, and beginning with Her Highness Princess Klaudia, succeeded in rescuing the hostages. Then yesterday, using the tolling noon bell of the Grancel Cathedral as a cue, a rescue team primarily made up of bracers and members of the Royal Guard pressed forward with a plan to storm the castle in a three-pronged attack from air, land and the underground. As rangers of the Royal Army under the command of the Intelligence Division fell upon the liberating group, a deadly battle with the Special Operations Unit erupted within the halls of Grancel Castle, and even spread to the lower levels. The struggle finally came to an end with the safe rescue of Her Majesty, Queen Alicia.
</p><p>At roughly the same time, a unit of the Royal Army that had come within sight of the castle ceased its advance after being persuaded to lay down arms by General Morgan, who had escaped from captivity and rushed to the Royal City. The coup d'etat plan which had been crafted by Richard and the Intelligence Division had been, without a doubt, thwarted at the narrow brink of no return.
</p>
<dl><dd>◆The Face of This Nameless Paramilitary Unit◆</dd></dl>
<p>As is evident from the information presented in this article, the ambitions of the Intelligence Division were not shattered by the strength of a lone hero, but by the combined courage of a host of unnamed individuals, who in the end wielded the strength necessary to bring down the curtains on this intricate scheme.
</p><p>It has also been rumored that a number of civilians stood shoulder to shoulder with the ranks of the Royal Guard and bracers in this endeavor. During this final struggle, the forces gathered together on the liberators' side were, in fact, put in a situation which many would agree was insufficient in terms of strength to combat this foe. However, it was the courage of these civilians that compensated for this deficiency.
</p><p>As a reporter caught up in the mix, I was also one of those individuals who found themselves being borne up by this incredible energy. Among those who gave me the strength to carry on were two junior bracers in particular, to whom I owe a special debt of gratitude; for without them, penning these articles would have been an impossibility.
</p><p>As we come to the end of these tumultuous events, I am once again overcome with feelings of reverence and thankfulness. The two individuals of whom I have spoken are scheduled to be awarded with their long-awaited status by the Bracer Guild at any moment. Please forgive my use of the following space for a personal message in consideration of the heroes who saved Liberl Kingdom.
</p><p>My heartiest congratulations to the both of you -- and if you're ever in the mood for curry, it's on me. -(N)

<dl><dt>[Society] Royal Guard Reinstated</dt></dl>
<p>The Royal Guard, which had been branded as terrorists and forced underground, has had its honor restored. The Army Strategic Operations Headquarters also decided today that the Royal Guard will be officially reinstated, and it is expected that 1st Lieutenant Schwarz and all of her fellow officers will be returning to their former unit.
</p>
<dl><dt>[Society] General Morgan Promoted</dt></dl>
<p>The coup d'etat plan was carried out by a division of the military that should have served as a protective shield to the public. The Royal Army itself, unable to forestall this serious incident despite the threat it posed to the nation, will refocus its prime objective on restructuring and reorganizing in order to prevent such future tragedies. To head that movement, the Royal Assembly has already proposed the leadership be awarded to General Morgan. The Royal Army has shown signs that it will comply with these demands, and General Morgan is expected to accede to the office of Commander of Strategic Operations.
</p><p>In addition, it was announced that former colonel Cassius Bright, who acted as the general's right-hand during the Hundred Days War, will be making a return, this time as an adjunct to the commander. The former colonel had, after the war, resigned from his post and transferred his considerable talents to the Bracer Guild.
</p>
<dl><dt>[Society] Mystery at the Tetracyclic Towers!</dt></dl>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, numerous reports came in from all over the kingdom in witness to a mysterious light. It has been said that a beam of light shone from the tops of the Tetracyclic Towers. We are presently awaiting an investigation into the matter, as no further details are known at this time.
