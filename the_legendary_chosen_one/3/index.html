<p><b>Chapter Three – The Chosen Ones</b>
</p><p>When he woke up, Ondel was still in the back seat of the car. The strange man from before was driving.
</p><p>‘Oh, you’re awake. Don’t get any funny ideas, all right? I got friends stationed in your village. You try to escape, and I give them the signal to torch the place. Understand?’
</p><p>‘...What are you going to do with me?’
</p><p>Ondel was trying his best not to sound scared.
</p><p>‘That’s a real talent you got there. It’s like you said: not just anyone can call down lightning without using a quartz or orbment. The way I see it, there’s all kinds of ways I can make money offa you’.
</p><p>The man spoke casually, as if kidnapping a child off the streets and threatening an entire village was the most natural thing in the world. Ondel hadn’t been tied up or gagged, but he still felt trapped. There were probably countless ways to escape from this situation, but he had no choice but to stay put.
</p><p>‘What am I doing?’ he thought. ‘I don’t have to do what this guy says. I could probably knock him out with a bolt of lightning… But what if I mess up and kill him? What if he gets his signal out and his friends burn down the village?’
</p><p>Ondel remembered how the old man in Heimdallr has scolded him for his irresponsible behavior, and the way his friends back home had acted.
</p><p>‘Keith and Monty were right. I’m no hero. Showing off just got people mad at me, and now I’m in this mess.’
</p><p>Being given a special power that was uniquely his had gone to his head, but he saw the truth now.
</p><p>He was still just a kid, and the situation he’d been put in made him feel more helpless than ever. The kidnapper smirked.
</p><p>‘Say goodbye to Erebonia, kid. Odds are you ain’t gonna see it again for a long time.’
</p><p>There was no response. In fact, the back of the car was unusually quiet all of a sudden. Was the kid just sulking? He adjusted the rearview mirror.
</p><p>‘Hey, I don’t know what you’re up to, but...’
</p><p>He was gone. There was no sign of Ondel anywhere. The kidnapper tried to twist around to see better, but the next moment, a shock went through his entire body. Ondel had crouched behind the driver’s seat and unleashed one of his bolts.
</p><p>‘Why, you little--!’
</p><p>The shock wasn’t enough to knock the kidnapper out, but it did slow him down long enough for Ondel to grab the steering wheel. The car veered off the edge of the road, swerving in every direction.
</p><p>‘You idiot! You’re gonna kill us both!’
</p><p>The kidnapper wrenched the wheel away just in time to avoid crashing into a tree, and slammed on the brakes, hard. While he was doing that, Ondel used a lightning punch to shatter the passenger side window, giving him the perfect escape route.
</p><p>‘So long, sucker! Thanks for slowing down for me!’
</p><p>A moment later, he jumped, entrusting his safety to Aidios.
</p><p>‘I know I’m just a kid. If anything really bad happens, there’s no way I’ll be able to make up for it. But I can’t just sit around and let this happen. I figure I can still do something!’
</p><p>For a moment, it seemed like Ondel was going to hit every branch on every tree before being dashed on the cliffs below. But then a blast of wind blew the branches aside and slowed his descent. He felt something –no, someone-- knock into him, and they both tumbled to the ground. They were shaken, but still very much alive. Ondel looked at the person who’d stepped in to rescue him. It was Monty, the boy who’d been blessed with the power of wind. He was panting for breath, but still managed to choke out a wry laugh.
</p><p>‘I never thought you’d actually get kidnapped. I thought that kind of stuff only happened in books.’
</p><p>‘Haha, yeah… Thanks, man. I would’ve been a goner for sure if you hadn’t been here. And…I’m sorry I got so carried away with the whole ‘world domination’ fantasy. I was being really dumb’
</p><p>‘No worries. I wasn’t sure I could be brave enough to do something like this, but when I saw you jump out the window, I didn’t even have to think about it. It just kinda…happened!’
</p><p>No sooner had Monty finished his speech, than they heard a loud bang from behind them, where the orbal car had been. They quickly turned to look.
</p><p>When Ondel jumped, the kidnapper didn’t chase after him. He was having enough trouble just trying to right the car and save his own skin.
</p><p>‘Stupid brat! I’m going to let the others know about this. You’re in for it now!’
</p><p>Driving out of the forest and back onto a solid road, he grabbed his communication device. The voice that answered him didn’t sound like any of his allies. It sounded a lot younger.
</p><p>‘Sorry, but your buddies are all tied up. You’re the only one left. Heh, and it looks like you saved us the trouble of finding you.’
</p><p>It was true. By some strange coincidence, the car had come to rest on the outskirts of Ondel’s village. And there was Keith, holding another comm device and fixing the kidnapper with a fierce look.
</p><p>‘Dammit! I don’t know what’s going on here, but I am sick and tired of you kids giving me the runaround!’
</p><p>He floored the accelerator, ready to drive right through Keith if necessary. The boy stayed calm, and sent a stream of water out of each of his hands, aiming at the car’s front tires. They burst with a mighty bang, and the car spun out of control toward another large tree. Keith summoned another stream of water, turning the ground to mud and stopping the vehicle in its tracks. He sighed.
</p><p>‘And here I told Ondel we should keep these powers secret… But I guess it’s okay to use them a little, if it means helping people.’
</p><p>With the kidnapper and his gang under lock and key, Ondel was free to return home to his friends and family. His parents scolded him for running off in the first place, but they hugged him that much harder now that they knew he was all right.
</p><p>At the time, he couldn’t put how he was feeling into words, but he could tell something had changed. He’d taken his first real step toward growing up.
</p><p>‘…This is just a story, of course, but you see the point I’m trying to make, right? Power on its own isn’t good for anything. Whatever kind of strength or talent your might have, think hard about how you can use it to improve the lives of others. Understand?’
</p><p>‘Yes, sir!’
</p><p>It was another normal day at a normal little academy. Instructor Ondel was well liked by his students—he always told the best stories. No one really knew what he did outside of working hours, though.
</p><p>
And no one would ever connect him or his two friends to the mysterious team that worked so hard to protect the people of Erebonia from the shadows. This was a group no one knew for sure even existed. It was just a rumor-- an urban legend. They had been chosen to wield power unlike anyone else, and in their own way, they had become heroes.</p><p></p></blockquote><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div> </div></div> </main>
