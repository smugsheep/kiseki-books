# kiseki-books

reader for books found in the kiseki/trails game series. 

notes: 

* raw book text (html) scrapped from the Fandom wiki via Python script, not available in repo (because bloat)
* the scraper file is a mess, use at own risk
* some texts not available in EN and/or JA randomly since the Fandom wiki is horribly kept

to-do (maybe):

* [x] change from SPA to file-based routing (i should have done this from the start)
* [x] clean up and refactor code because it is ugly
* [ ] scrape images to local instead of using linking to wiki images
* [ ] make the scraper nicer
* [ ] somehow, maybe manually, get texts missing from the wiki
